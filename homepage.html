A former captain in all formats, Kohli retired from Twenty20 International (T20I) following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>

    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the 
	legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of 
	cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor", he is widely considered to have the potential
	to surpass his records in the future. His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he
	idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated 
	that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to
	hit sixes in a similar manner.In 2015, Kohli invested a sum of â‚¹90 crore (US$11 million) 
	towards the establishment of a chain of health clubs and fitness centers throughout India. 
	Dubbed as "Chisel", the network of gyms was established through a joint venture between Kohli,
	Chisel India, and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the organization responsible
	for managing Kohli's commercial pursuits. In September of the same year, Kohli expanded
	his portfolio of sports-related investments by becoming a co-owner of the International
	Premier Tennis League franchise, UAE Royals. In quick succession, he also became a
	co-owner of the JSW-owned Bengaluru Yodhas franchise in the Pro Wrestling League.

In the year 2016, Kohli embarked on a new venture, which aimed to promote fitness among children. He joined forces with Stepathlon Lifestyle to launch Stepathlon Kids. The initiative aimed to encourage young individuals to adopt healthy lifestyle habits and inculcate the love for physical activity.</p>
